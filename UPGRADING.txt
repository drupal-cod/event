There are two updates available now:

1. If if you are upgrading from either Drupal 4.5 or CivicSpace 0.8.0.x to Drupal 4.6 or the equivalent CivicSpace version.
2. If you are running the pre-daylight savings time supported 4.6 version of event. If you were running v4.6 event without
   a event_timezones.inc file in the event directory, this is you. You can also check to see if your event table has a 'tz' field
   instead of a 'timezone' field.

To update do the following:

 * Copy the file update-event.php to the root directory of your Drupal installation.
 * Login as user 1, or disable the access checking at the top of that file.
 * Point your browser to "http://www.site.com/update-event.php" and follow the
   instructions.

** NOTE **

YOU MUST HAVE FLEXINODE INSTALLED TO UPDATE FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF EVENT TO v4.6

Clean installs do not have this limitation, although using flexinode is strongly recommended to enhance your event module experience.
