Description
-----------------
Adds an 'all day' checkbox to the event form. When checked, the time fields are hidden and set to midnight.

TODO
-----------------
When showing the edit form, javascript decides to hide the fields if both are at midnight. This could be done in php which would
save a minor flicker after page renders.
