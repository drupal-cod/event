Requirements
------------

This module requires Drupal 4.3 or higher.

Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the
   most common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < event.mysql

2. Place the event module with all its files under modules/event.

3. Enable the module in admin >> site configuration >> modules 
   and set the module settings to your liking in 
   admin >> site configuration >> modules >> event.

4. Optionally add custom fields by editing the function in
   the fields.inc source code file. If you want to add fields
   that have an extra entry in the database, you need to add those
   entries to the event table. Only fields with their own db column are included on the search form
