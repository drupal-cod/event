Requirements
------------

To validate external files you have to make sure that PHP was compiled with
'--enable-ftp' and the PHP setting allow_url_fopen is 'on'.

This module requires the lastest version of the current Drupal CVS version.

Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
   common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < file.mysql

2. Copy the file.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

3. Check the "settings and filters" in the administration and set the module
   settings to your liking.

4. You can add content using the node.module administration. For submissions
   add a category of file node in the structure.module. Then use the submission
   queue to submit the files.

Wish list
--------

This is in no particular order.

- Support for file uploads.
- Tool for administrators to copy an external file to a local directory.
- Icons or a way to display a file is "hot" and/or "new". The latter might be
  more appropriate in a theme though.
- Stricter control on what can be submitted. This will stay on the wish list
  till the structure.module is redone, and hopefully has some method to attach
  node type configuration settings to the category.
- Improved download counter to prevent people from boosting downloads too
  easilly.
