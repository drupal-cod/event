# Welcome to cod!
COD, or Conference Organizing Distribution, is an installation profile for 
Drupal, that makes it easy to create a conference website with features 
like event signup, session proposal, session voting/judging, session 
selection/scheduling, and social networking prior to events. Read more 
about COD's features on usecod.com and https://www.drupal.org/project/cod

For the latest information related to the process of porting this
installation profile to D8, be sure to see https://www.drupal.org/node/2605232

For additional information about the D8 profile, including terminology we use,
see https://github.com/drupal-cod/cod/blob/master/README.md

## Event
An event is all the conference sessions in one particular timeframe, e.g., 
Drupaldelphia 2016, vs. Drupaldelphia 2018. Grouping by events allows
conference organizers to create repeating events, while reusing locations
or timeslots from previous events.
